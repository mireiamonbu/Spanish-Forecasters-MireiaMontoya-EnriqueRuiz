# Value of the Forecast 
Accurate daily electricity generation forecast provide significant operational, economic and social value. In power systems, electricity must be balanced in reall time, and forecasting errors can lead to inefficient decisions, increased costs and higher emissions. 

By forecasting daily generation by technology, this project enables system operators and planners to anticipate potential generation shortfalls or execesses and take preventive actions such as activating backup generaton, adjusting imports and exports, or rescheduling maintenance. 

Small forecast errors can have a big economic impact. For example, an average daily error of 1 GWh may require emergency thermal generation with marginal costs in the range of 100-200 €/MWh, resulting in daily costs of 100,000-200,000 €. Over a monthl horizon, this can accumulate to several million euros. 

The inclusion of 95% prediction intervals allows decision-makers to explicitly account for uncertainty. Rather than relying on a single point forecast, we can assess risk scenarios and adopt conservative or aggressive strategies depending on the wigth an dposition of the forecast intervals. 

However, this can't be only taken as a economic value, the forecasts support also the integration of renewable energy, reduce CO2 emissions, etc. to generate clear social and environmental benefits.
